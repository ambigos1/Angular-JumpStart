# Angular JumpStart with TypeScript BNY Mellon Developer test

The goal of this jumpstart app is to provide a Developr test to a position at BNY Mellon

## Hosted Demo

https://bnymellontest.ey.r.appspot.com/

## Running the Application with Node.js (server side) And Angular as client side

1. Install the latest LTS version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org. *IMPORTANT: The server uses ES2015 features AND the Angular CLI so you need a current version of Node.js.*

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `ng build --watch` to build and bundle the code

1. Run `npm run start` to run our backend and UI

app should be listen on  http://localhost:8080
## Running angular tests (client side)

1. Run `ng test` to run our tests

#### Personal notes

My first priority was to add the option for user to add new orders with minimum clicks and effort, user can add multiples order without leaving the page.
By doing so we can give the user the best UX and optimize our orders ;)

The Only thing that slowed me down is to upload the site to google cloud app engine
